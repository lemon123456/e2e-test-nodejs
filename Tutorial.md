#Gulp

Install the library locally and the CLI globally:

```
npm install --save-dev gulp
npm install --global gulp-cli
```
The CLI provides us with the gulp command, which allows us to call Gulp tasks. 



#HTTP Server

Use [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) and [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static):
```
npm install --save-dev connect serve-static
```
Add serv
* With command ```gulp http```, you should see something like that:

```
[10:14:13] Using gulpfile ~/Documents/AutoTest/UI_Test/e2e-testing/gulpfile.js
[10:14:13] Starting 'http'...
[10:14:13] Finished 'http' after 2.77 ms
```
